#+TITLE: README
Similar utility functions have been implemented across many of sakay's web
services and clients. This library aims to provide some DRYness and sanity to
all this.

* Installation

Because we don't have a private clojars repository, we'll have to use the git
deps system provided by tools.deps.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
