#+TITLE: README
Similar utility functions have been implemented across many of sakay's web
services and clients. This library aims to provide some DRYness and sanity to
all this.

Because we don't have a private clojars repository, we'll have to use the git
deps system provided by tools.deps.

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:deps {sakay-web-utils {:git/url "https://gitlab.byimplication.com/sakay/sakay-web-utils"
                         :sha "8c679a027cd070cb04669c31b91d236be8519893"}}}

andrewmcveigh's cljs-time was the go-to cljs time library in its day, but with
the advent of java's new time library and its superiority over jodatime, there
is no longer any reason to keep using clj-time, and therefore cljs-time loses
its appeal as a drop-in replacement. gfZeng's time.clj is fully portable and its
server-side implementation runs off the new java time.
