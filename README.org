Similar utility functions have been implemented across many of sakay's web
services and clients. This library aims to provide some DRYness and sanity to
all this.

andrewmcveigh's cljs-time was the go-to cljs time library in its day, but with
the advent of java's new time library and its superiority over jodatime, there
is no longer any reason to keep using clj-time, and therefore cljs-time loses
its appeal as a drop-in replacement. gfZeng's time.clj is fully portable and its
server-side implementation runs off the new java time.
